# ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Sc489w0/Lo-LEng-Small.png) Force English language for LoL in Garena regions
A script that forces Garena League of Legends to run in English.
This shouldn't get you banned as it only restarts League of Legends in English once a non-English instance is detected. No files are modified.
- Tutorial:
  - Run the script as admin before you launch League of Legends.
  - As long as the script is running League of Legends should launch in English.
- Todo:
  - Turn it into a tray app
